Classifier for metagenomic sequences

Centrifuge is a very rapid and memory-efficient system for the classification of DNA sequences from microbial samples, with better sensitivity than and comparable accuracy to other leading systems.  The system uses a novel indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, optimized specifically for the metagenomic classification problem.  Centrifuge requires a relatively small index (e.g., 2.9 GB for ~2,800 bacterial genomes) yet provides very fast classification speed, allowing it to process a typical DNA sequencing run within an hour.  Together these advances enable timely and accurate analysis of large metagenomics data sets on conventional desktop computers.
